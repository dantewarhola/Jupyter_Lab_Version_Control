# Version-Control
10/4 Lab for CMPINIF0010

For our program,we made 3 variable "name" "age" and "message", it would take the user's input of name and age and combine it in message and print the message
We chose this code of conduct because it is the most popular one, and we chose the mit license because it is the most generic license for programming.
